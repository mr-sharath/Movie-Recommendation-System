# Movie Recommendation System

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze people's movie preferences by studying their viewing and rating history. Using **Association Rule Mining**, this system identifies patterns and determines which movies or genres are commonly watched together. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into how a basic recommendation system works.

## **Features**
- Analyze movie viewing and rating history.
- Identify associations between movies and genres.
- Predict a list of recommended movies based on user-selected inputs.
- Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
To test the code, ensure you have the following:
1. Python installed on your system.
2. Required libraries from `requirements.txt` installed.
3. Datasets:
   - `movies.csv`
   - `ratings.csv`

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-sharath/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Place the required datasets (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`) in the project directory.

### Running the Application
Run the following command to launch the interactive UI:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### How to Use
1. Open the application in your web browser (Streamlit will provide a link).
2. Select **three movies** from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the **Predict** button to generate the top 10 recommended movies based on your choices.

## **Project Objective**
- Use **Association Rule Mining** to identify patterns in movie-watching habits.
- Build a system that predicts movie recommendations based on user inputs.

## **Dataset**
- `movies.csv`: Contains information about movies.
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for various movies.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** for backend development.
- **Streamlit** for building the interactive UI.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and model implementation.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporate collaborative filtering techniques for improved recommendations.
- Expand the dataset to include more movies and user interactions.
- Add user authentication for personalized recommendations.
